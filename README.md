# Project5-OpenClassrooms
Segment the customers of an e-commerce site

## Business case
Olist is a Brazilian company that offers a sales solution on online marketplaces.

The company wants to provide its e-commerce teams with a customer segmentation that they can use on a daily basis for their communication campaigns.

For this mission, Olist provided an anonymized database containing information on order history, products purchased, satisfaction comments, and customer location since January 2017. 

## Objectives

My goal is to understand the different types of users through their behavior and personal data.

I will have to provide the marketing team with an actionable description of my segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a proposal for a maintenance contract based on an analysis of the stability of the segments over time
